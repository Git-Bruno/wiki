To make a __new plugin install__, please follow [the install procedure](Plugin_Installation.md). For the moment, only the manual installation on Linux has been tested and validated.

To upgrade from version 5 to version 6, the procedure is described below. __It is only valid for manual installation on Linux__.

Testers for other operating systems are welcome!!

## Prerequisites

Before strating the procedure, you should :

* Have a version of DomoticZ 2021.1 at least.
* Be on plugin's __Stable5__ branch. Command `git checkout stable5` if needed.
* Have the latest version of the plugin. Command `git pull` if needed.

## Backup

Even if the procedure has been tested several times, things may not go as planned.
It is recommended to make a full backup so that you can go back if necessary.
Remember to save :

* DomoticZ
* The plugin's data
* The operating system

## Procedure

Open the terminal.

1. Stop DomoticZ. The command is usually :

    ``` bash
    sudo service domoticz.sh stop
    ```

1. Go in the plugin directory. The command is usually :

    ``` bash
    cd domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate
    ```

1. Run the command :

    ``` bash
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zigbeefordomoticz/Domoticz-Zigbee
    ```

1. If not done yet do update the repository

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

1. Switch to stable6 or stable6 (as you whish)

    ```bash
    git checkout stable6
    ```

1. Install the necessary Python packages with the command :

    go to the plugin folder domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigbee (or Domoticz-Zigate)

    ``` bash
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Execute the command by adapting pi:pi if necessary to the user:group used. Be careful to take the point at the end.

    ``` bash
    sudo chown -R pi:pi .
    ```

1. Run the command :

    ``` bash
    git config --add submodule.recurse true
    ```

1. Install the missing Python libraries with the command :

    ``` bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

1. Make the __plugin.py__ file executable with the command :

    ``` bash
    sudo chmod +x plugin.py
    ```

1. Restart DomoticZ. The command is usually :

    ``` bash
    sudo service domoticz.sh start
    ```

    Normally, the name of the plugin in hardware has become __ZigBee for DomoticZ__.

    From now on, the term ZiGate is replaced by __coordinateur__, more generic.

    If you already have a plugin configured with a ZiGate as coordinator, you don't have to do anything : the plugin should continue to     work normally.

## Settings

There are 4 possible coordinator models:

* ZiGate : no changes to the existing plugin.
* ZiGate + : no changes to the existing plugin.
* ZiGate (via zigpy) : the plugin communicates with the ZiGate through zigpy libraries. It's only experimental and won't be supported.
* Texas Instruments ZNP : for  TI Brand Coordinators.
* Silicon Labs EZSP: for the Silicon Labs Coordinators.
* deConz: for the deConz Coordinators like RaspBee and ConBee

## IMPORTANT Plugin's update

The `git pull` is no longer sufficient, it is now necessary to make the command `git pull --recurse-submodules`.

## Plugin Version 6 running on Windows

### Assumptions

* [Domoticz Installation](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Windows) has been followed
* [Installing Python for Windows](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Using_Python_plugins#Installing_Python_for_Windows)
* [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) is installed, and especially Git Bash

### How to install the python additional modules

You must start a Git Bash windows in with administrator privileges

In order to install modules globally under C:\Program Files\Python3xx\Lib\site-packages start CMD prompt as administrator and then install modules. But make sure that you didn't install the module before for the user, if that is the case you need to remove them.

Make sure to be in the pluin home directory ( domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigbee )

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Make the Symbolic links correct

a file `symlink.bat` is available on the home directory of the plugin, make sure to execute it with Administrator privileges

### Last check

Go in the Zigbee for Domoticz folder ( Domoticz-Zigbee ). Usally you should be under domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigbee
run: `git config --add submodule.recurse true`
run: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
Restart Domoticz.
