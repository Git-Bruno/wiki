# Zigbee for Domoticz Troubleshooting guide

## Where can I get support

Welcome to Zigbee for Domoticz.
The first source of support is the Wiki

* [English Wiki](https://zigbeefordomoticz.github.io/wiki/en-eng/)
* [French Wiki](https://zigbeefordomoticz.github.io/wiki/fr-fr/)
* [Dutch Wiki](https://zigbeefordomoticz.github.io/wiki/nl-dut/) Unfortunatly outdated. Please contact us if you are willing to contribute in the udpate of this wiki

You can also get support and ask questions on the [English Forum](https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=68), [French Forum](https://easydomoticz.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=28) or on the [Keybase English channel](https://keybase.io/team/zigateforum) or [keybase French channel](https://keybase.io/team/zigate)

## I'm using a SONOFF Zigbee USB Dongle Plus, but it is not working

I can see in the log file ( domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigbee/Logs/PluginZigbee-xx.log ) some messages like that

```

2022-02-25 00:20:45,084 ERROR   : [       MainThread] [   ] Stop the plugin and check the Coordinator connectivity.

```

This indicate a miss communication between the plugin and the dongle. you need to cross-check the following pieces in the Domoticz Hardware menu:

* ensure that the serial port is the right one.
* ensure that the Coordinator Model matchs your dongle (in that case it must be Texas Instrument ZNP (via zigpy)
* ensure that there is not an other process running on the port

## I cannot get my TI CCxxx dongle working with the plugin

In that case, we suggest that you try to test the TI CCxxx dongle without Domoticz and the plugin.

1. make sure that the plugin is stopped
2. Installed missing python modules if requires `sudo pip3 install jsonschema coloredlogs`
3. from the plugin home folder `domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigbee`, run `python3 -m zigpy_znp.tools.energy_scan /dev/ttyUSB0`where /dev/ttyUSB0 is the serial port to the USB dongle

This should provide you a scan of all Zigbee channels and reports the level of noise

If you do not succeed here, this mean that something is wrong between the system and the USB dongle

## Pairing issues - Not able to pair a device, the pairing works, but the device doesn't work or doesn't behave as expected

Please check [here](https://zigbeefordomoticz.github.io/wiki/en-eng/Problem_Dealing-with-none-certified-device.html)

## I want to debug myself and get more logs

Please check [here](https://zigbeefordomoticz.github.io/wiki/en-eng/Problem_Debuging-mode.html)

## While running , I see some `Decode8000`errors in the log file

if you see error logs like here after, this is most-likely an issue with the ZiGate hardware.

```

```

* make sure that you don't have the old __blue__ USB-TTL module (it must be a red one )
* try to power off the ZiGate by stopping the plugin, removing ZiGate, wait for 1 minute, plug-in back and restart the plugin

## Where can I find the list of supported Coordinators and Devices

Please check the  [Zigbee Device Compatibility Repository](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/z4d.html)

## Can I use several dongles in the same Domoticz

We have currently a limitation of the nimber of instances using Zigpy layer, which prevent having several instances of zigpy based communication.

If you use ZiGate hardware, you can run as many plugin instances ( one instance per ZiGate ) as you wish.
If you use non-ZiGate hardware, like TI CCxxxx or Silicon Labs, you can run only one instance of those 2, but still can mix with as many ZiGate as you want.

## Where can I find the coordinator firmwares

* For Texas Instrument we recommend to use the Z-Stack firmware from @Koenkk available [here](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator). we do not recommend to use _develop_ branch and rely on the _master_
* For ZiGate, the firmware are available [here for Zigate V1](https://github.com/fairecasoimeme/ZiGate/releases) or [here for ZiGate+ V2](https://github.com/fairecasoimeme/ZiGateV2/releases)
* For EZNP (Silicon Labs) we recommend to follow the [zigpy recommendations](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/wiki/Coordinator-Firmware-Updates)
