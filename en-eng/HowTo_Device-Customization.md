# How-To get devices well integrated with the plugin

## Overview

It might happen that your device is well paired with the coordinator and the plugin, but do not behave has expected.
The plugin is providing a way to overwrite the Zigbee standard behaviour by adding specifics to the device plugin configuration.

| ----          | -------- |
| check_store_value    | store the value to the corresponding Ep, Cluster,Attribute |
| upd_domo_device | request an update of the corresponding ClusterType for this value of Cluster|

## evaluation

* _value_ is a special variable which contained the zigbee device value

1. Transform a centi-degree _value_ into degree

    ``` "eval": "round(int(value) / 100, 1)", ```

2. transform the received data ( _value_ ) into the Atmo Pressure as per the Zigbee standard

    ``` "eval": "round(int(value) * pow( 10, scale), 1)", ```

3. transform the Scaled Pressure measurement.

   1. retreive the _scale_ in attribute 0x0014 of cluster 0x0403
   2. evaluate the the formula with the retreived _scale_ information

    ```json
    {
     "evalInputs": {"scale": { "Cluster": "0403", "Attribute": "0014"}},
     "eval": "round(int(value) * pow( 10, scale), 1)",
    }
     ```

## Device module

### overview

instead of using eval which is limited to simple expression, you can implement a full python function to handle the value as an input and return the result.
If returning None, no action will be taken

### How-to

1. Create your python3 module file in the  `DevicesModules`folder
1. Code your custom function in the \<manufacturer\>.py module

    * The function can take only 2 parameters `self` and `value`
    * The function must return something

    ```python
    def custom_<manufactuer>_function(self, value):

        return value
    ```

1. Integrate the function in the flow
    1. Edit the file DevicesModules/__init__.py, just follow the same as what has already been done
       * import your module
       * link the function to the stanza you will put in the conf file

    ```python
    from DevicesModules.custom_konke import konke_onoff

    FUNCTION_MODULE = {
        "konke_onoff": konke_onoff,
    }
    ```

### Optimize a non-yet optimized device

It is likely that your device - if fully Zigbee 3.0 compliant - works well with the plugin. It means that you have paired the device, and automatically the plugin made a descovery of the device features and created the corresponding domoticz widgets.

In that case, it might be efficient to get the plugin fully aware of what the device is and is not capable.

To do so, you have to create a 'config' file under the `Conf/Certified/\<manufacturer name\>` folder.

1. First you need to extract raw device informations from the plugin.

   1. open the WebUI and go to the Device Management section

    ![WebUI:Device Management](Images/EN_WebUI_Device-Management-Not_Optimized.png)

   1. as shown on the here above screenshot you'll see a list of device, and the one with the yellow icon refer to devices for which there is no associated config file for the plugin and their behaviour might not be optimum.

   1. Click on the yellow icon, it will copy immediately the necessary information to the Clipboard. You can then paste in the Json viewer ( like that one [JsonViewer](https://countwordsfree.com/jsonviewer). You will see a resultat like this one

    ![JsonViewer Exemple](../Images/jsonviewer.png)

1. Create the configuration file for this device

    1. You have to create the file under the `Conf/Certified/00Local` folder
    1. You have to create the file with a specific name. The name is based on the Zigbee Model identifier you can get in the json file, look at attribute `Model`, and create the file as _modelname_.json.

    for exemple if we look after the Json file above, the Zigbee model identifier is __lumi.weather__, so you will create a file name __Conf/Certified/00Local/lumi.weather.json__

    you can initialize the file with the following content, that we will show how to update in the next steps

    ```json
    {
        "_comment": "",
        "_blakadder": "",
        "_version": "",
        "Ep": {
            "01": {
                "0000": "",
                "Type": ""
            }
        },
        "Type": "",
        "ClusterToBind": [ ],
        "ConfigureReporting": {
        },
        "ReadAttributes": {
        },
        "Param": {
        },
    }
    ```

1. Update the attributes

    * __"\_comment":__  _put what ever comment you would like. We are recommending to put at least the Device Product Name and manufacturer_
    * __"\_blakadder":__  _you can add here the link to the [blakadder](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/) web site, where your device is referenced. If the device is not yet referenced, we strongly recommend you to request to get it in._
    * __"\_version":__ _this is a version number you can put._

1. Update the "Ep" section

    Here we have to declare what are the Endpoint (EP) the device has and what are the Clusters available on each of the EP. for more information on Ep and Clusters I suggest you to look after the [Zigbee technical presentation](https://csa-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/zigbee-technical-presentation.zip)

    During pairing, the plugin started a discovery process and interviewed the device for the list of endpoints, and the supported clusters for each of the endpoint. This information will be found on the Json.

    In the here after exemple you can see a somehow complex device which has 3 endpoints.

    ![Json Complex EndPoint Device CMS323](../Images/Json_Endoint.png)

    We can see :

    3 Endpoints : 0x01, 0x02 and 0x04 and we see for each of the ep the associated cluster.

    This will result in the following config file where fo each Endpoint we have listed the available cluster and we have also define what are the associated Domoticz Widgets.

        ```json
        {
            "Ep": {
                "01": {
                    "0000": "",
                    "0001": "",
                    "0003": "",
                    "0500": "",
                    "Type": "Motion/Voltage"
                },
                "02": {
                    "0001": "",
                    "0402": "",
                    "0405": "",
                    "Type": "Temp/Humi"
                },
                "04": {
                    "0001": "",
                    "0500": "",
                    "Type": "Switch"
                }
           },
           "Type": "",
        .....
        ```

    | Ep | Widget | Cluster source of information |
    | -- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
    | 01 | Motion | The motion detection will come from the Cluster 0x0500 ( IAS ), Domoticz will switch the Motion widget from On to Off depending on the notification |
    |    | Voltage| The device will send voltage information via the cluster 0x0001 ( Power ), and domoticz will displayed thge voltage value |
    | 02 | Temperature | The device will send Temperature information via cluster 0x0402 |
    |    | Humidity | Humidity info will be provided from cluster 0x0405 |
    | 04 | Switch | The device offer the possibility to detect vibration on cluster 04 and the cluster 0500 will be used for |

    if you look to the Json you could say that there is less clusters than  the reallity discovered by the plugin.
    Indeed, cluster 0x0000 is mentioned only one on the Ep 01, which we consider suffisant and there is no need to get the same information accross several Ep.

    In summary __Type__ is corresponding to the Domoticz Widget to be created and used to display sensor information as well as handling actions
