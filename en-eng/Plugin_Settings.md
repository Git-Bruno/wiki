| __Name__                  | Fill a Coordinator's Name  | This is the name you want to set for the instance of the plugin. In case you run several Zigate, you'll have several instance of this Plugin Hardware and so the name will help you to distinguish each of them.<br/><br/>It is advisable not to put any space or special character in the name of the Plugin. This name can be used in a URL and a space or special characters can generate problems. |
| __Type__                 | Select `ZigBeeForDomoticZ plugin` | If ZigBeeForDomoticZ plugin does not appear at the bottom of the list, it is because the plugin is not properly installed.

| __Port s√©rie__           | Select the USB port to which the coordinator is plugged | Remember to fix the port of your usb equipment [Persistent USB](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/PersistentUSBDevices)|

| __Initialize Coordinator | Select True to initialize the coordinator with the plugin settings (False by default). <br/>__Must be activated__ during initial configuration (ou after an Erase EEPROM of a ZiGate). | __ATTENTION :__ Activation will erase all pairing information from the coordinator.<br/> Restart the Plugin to start initialization. Verify that the setting is in a False state after reboot. |
| __Debugging__ | Leave empty |

* If it is for a first installation of the Plugin with a new coordinator, set Initialize Coordinator to __True__, otherwise always leave to __False__ (this parameter erases the coordinator's information).

* Click on __Add__.

* Set __Initialize ZCoordinator (Erase Memory)__ to __False__.

* Unchecked __Activate__ to disable the plugin.

* Click on __Modify__ (do not click Add as this will duplicate the plugin).
